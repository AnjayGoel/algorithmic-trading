# Algorithmic-Trading
My python implementation of trading strategies discussed in the book [Algorithmic Trading By Ernie Chan](https://www.amazon.in/Algorithmic-Trading-Winning-Strategies-Rationale/dp/1118460146) using data from Indian markets.

### How to run
Didn't use notebooks because resuing code from other notebooks is a pain in the neck. To run simply:
* Create virtual enviornment and install requirements
* Excute files as modules using -m option. Ex: `python -m strategies.mean_reversion.adf_and_hurst`

### Data Sources
* [NSE Website](https://www.nseindia.com/)
* Google Finance
* [Zerodha Kite Connect API](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/)
